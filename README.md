# Vobalist

Vobalist is a [spaced repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) application
that can run from your mobile device,
even when you have no access to the Internet.
Since spaced repetition requires strict adherence to a schedule for effective results,
Vobalist can help you maintain your pace even when you aren't in front of your computer.

The name "vobalist" began its life as a typo,
but in light of [another famous typo](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/google_name_origin.html)
and the fact that vobalist is a more unique search engine query
than the correct spelling of "verbalist",
we've decided to stick with it.
